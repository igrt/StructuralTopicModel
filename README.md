This script loads several libraries that are required for the analysis, including LexisNexisTools, dplyr, quanteda, stm, wordcloud, igraph, stminsights, tidyverse, and ggplot2.

It then reads in a set of documents in .docx format and creates a data frame from them. The script filters out any documents that do not have a valid date, and then transforms the dates to a numeric format.

The script then performs an STM analysis on the documents, creating 20 topics. It gets the common words for each topic and defines custom topic names. It then displays the topics in a plot, ordered by expected topic proportions.

The script uses the reshape2 package to plot the distribution of words in selected topics. It saves the resulting plot to a file named "topic_word_distribution.png".

The script also finds the top 10 most representative documents for a specified topic using the findThoughts function, and computes the topic correlation using the topicCorr function.

The script then estimates the effect of the date on the topics using the estimateEffect function and plots the effect of the date for selected topics. It saves the resulting plot to a file named "topic_time_effect.png".

Finally, the script creates a document-topic matrix, calculates topic proportions for each document, adds the topic proportions to the original data frame, and saves the resulting data frame to a CSV file named "document_topic_proportions.csv".
